# rock-band-night
A Rails app that supplements your Rock Band gaming nights.
## Planned Features
1. Seed initial Database through RBDB (will add in songs manually since they stopped updating, to demonstrate functionality)
2. Booklet PDF Export, similar to karaoke songbooks.
3. Party Mode UI, to display songs waiting to be played along with the ability to shuffle and delete from an account with Host privileges.
4. TPA via XBox Live and PSN, in order to facilitate in-app links to purchase unowned downloadable content.
5. Import songs via Host user's in-game song cache.
6. Import songs via screenshots from official RB Companion App.
7. Manual import of songs, if both options are not viable.
8. Regular updates to database of selectable DLC mimicing official release schedule (Fridays).
9. Macros for automatically selecting next song in playlist. *possibly XBox only* 
9. More to come, if I begin to overthink things a lot more.
